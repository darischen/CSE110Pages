## About Me
Hello! I'm Daris Chen, a passionate programmer based in California. here's a bit about me:

- **Github:** https://github.com/darischen
- **Linkedin:** https://linkedin.com/darischen

As a naturally curious individual, I find that learning is all around us. One quote that I came across that really resonates with the learning process is
> The bigger the circle of the known the greater the contact with the unknown.\

I am constantly learning new things, especially as a student at UCSD, which uses the quarter system as the basis of their academic calendar.\

## Languages
One of my favorite programming languages is Python because of its versatility. Of course, my first snippet of programming in Python is obviously

```
    print("Hello World!")
```
However, Python is not the only programming language that I know. Some other languages that I have used are:
- C++
- C
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
  
## Hobbies
Here are a few hobbies that I participate in:

**Weightlifting**\
I try to go to the gym 4 or 5 days a week, except when midterm season or finals season is in session.

**Golf**\
I am a self-taught golfer, though very much a beginner. I would like to practice more often, but studying for EE classes takes a large chunk of my time. However, when I do go to the range, I focus on my irons my short game the most.

**Custom Keyboards**\
I have a custom keyboard that I've built in summer of 2023. Here are the components I've used:
1. Keychron Q1 Pro
2. Boba U14 Silent Tactical Switches
3. Cherry Profile ABS Keycaps
4. Foam Modded Chassis
5. Manual Lubed Switches
